/**
 * This program is to demonstrate different lambda expression
 * lambda expression can be used to pass around functioanlity
 * (i.e. a piece of code) as data
 * 
 * Why to use it?
 * => Mainly you will use it to do syntactic suger (my personal opinion)
 * But it can also be used for scenario like
 * 1. Avoiding annonymous class which may seem too verbose for small functionality
 * 2. Creating an interface object (same can be done by annonymous class)
 * 2. Pass a function like data, now you can wrap a sequence of operation 
 * in a function/method
 * 
 * We will demonstrate just that
